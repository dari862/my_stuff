  # Offset is the extra space around each character. `offset.y` can be thought of
  # as modifying the line spacing, and `offset.x` as modifying the letter spacing.
 # offset:
 #   x: -1
 #   y: -1

  # Glyph offset determines the locations of the glyphs within their cells with
  # the default being at the bottom. Increasing `x` moves the glyph to the right,
  # increasing `y` moves the glyph upwards.

# If `true`, bold text is drawn using the bright color variants.
