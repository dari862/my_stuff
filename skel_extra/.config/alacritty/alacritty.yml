# Visual Bell
#
# Any time the BEL code is received, Alacritty "rings" the visual bell. Once
# rung, the terminal background will be set to white and transition back to the
# default background color. You can control the rate of this transition by
# setting the `duration` property (represented in milliseconds). You can also
# configure the transition function by setting the `animation` property.
#
# Values for `animation`:
#   - Ease
#   - EaseOut
#   - EaseOutSine
#   - EaseOutQuad
#   - EaseOutCubic
#   - EaseOutQuart
#   - EaseOutQuint
#   - EaseOutExpo
