"Alternatives"
=====================
The "Alternatives" are four groups added to the Debian Alternatives:

        my-file-manager
        my-text-editor
        my-image-viewer
        my-media-player

They can be used in menus, keyboard shortcuts, config files and scripts
just like any other command, and will call up whatever application has been
set as that alternative. Often the setting will be done automatically, but
even done manually it only needs to be done once to cover
all the calls to that command. (See "Editing Alternatives" below.)

The default settings in a new install are:

        my-file-manager Thunar
        my-text-editor  Geany
        my-image-viewer Viewnior
        my-media-player MPC

The only difference from the other Debian alternatives is that they are
not automatically added by packages themselves.
For example, when xfce4-terminal is installed, it will add itself to the
available options for my-terminal-emulator. However, even though pcmanfm is
a possible alternative for my-file-manager the pcmanfm package will not add
itself to that alternatives group. That job is done by the bl-alternatives
script which is called automatically by dpkg after each package install.
(It is very fast and does not significantly slow down the install.)

The applications which can be added by bl-alternatives are:
        my-file-manager: thunar caja nautilus pcmanfm spacefm xfe
        my-text-editor: geany emacs gedit jedit kate leafpad medit mousepad scite
        my-image-viewer: mirage eog eom gpicview viewnior
        my-media-player: vlc banshee dragonplayer gnome-mplayer gxine kaffeine parole smplayer totem

Note: gvim is also an option for my-text-editor, but
 is handled specially (wrapper and man page names differ).

You can change these by editing /usr/bin/bl-alternatives,
or add an app to an alternative group manually (see below).

Editing Alternatives
====================
You can edit any Debian Alternatives with the command 'update-alternatives' 
(see 'man update-alternatives'), but there is also a graphic front end 
called Galternatives which is easier to use in some ways.

In the bl-menu, click "System" > "Edit Debian Alternatives".
You can scroll down the list to see what alternative groups have been
installed on your system, what options are available for each group
and if there is more than one option you can set a different one.

You can also add a new application to an existing alternative group,
so if the bl-alternatives script has failed to add your favourite
image viewer to my-image-viewer you can add it manually here.

It is not possible to remove a whole group with galternatives,
but you can remove an individual option from some group.

NOTE: These settings are system-wide, affecting all users.
If you want a local version of my-file-manager set to eg spacefm,
while leaving the system setting unchanged, then put a symbolic link
called 'my-file-manager' in ~/bin which points to /usr/bin/spacefm.
If ~/bin is in your $PATH and comes before /usr/bin then your symlink
will override the system my-file-manager.

See 'man update-alternatives' for details of the Debian Alternatives.
