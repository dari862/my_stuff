#  Wrapper script to invoke gvim in GUI mode, typically used as target of a
#  link (like /etc/alternatives/my-text-editor).  Rationale: only links to
#  /usr/bin/vim.* starting with the letter 'g' like /etc/alternatives/gvim or
#  gnome-text-editor actually invoke GUI mode (without using the -g option).
